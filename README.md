# ireal-musicxml

iReal to MusicXML converter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/infojunkie/ireal-musicxml.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/infojunkie/ireal-musicxml)

# Usage

```
import iReal2MusicXML from 'ireal-musicxml'
const ireal = // HTML file generated by iReal Pro
const xmls = iReal2MusicXML.convert(ireal) // Array of MusicXML strings
```

# Development

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

`xmllint` is required to run tests (but NOT at runtime). It is used to ensure that the generated MusicXML is valid.

# Known issues
- No chord (N.C.) MusicXML spec [needs a `root/root-step`](https://forums.makemusic.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=2476#p9099), which [confuses MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en/node/313008).
- Generating a staff note for each chord [confuses MuseScore into playing that (dummy) note](https://musescore.org/en/node/313008), which is only there to indicate the rhythm structure. Currently using `note/unptiched` which is not understood by MuseScore.
